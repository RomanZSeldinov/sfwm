sfwm - super feeble window manager
============================
sfwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic WM for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build sfwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sfwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sfwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running sfwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start sfwm using startx:

    exec sfwm

In order to connect sfwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec sfwm

(This will start sfwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while true
    do
        xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
        sleep 1
    done &
    exec sfwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of sfwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
