sfwm - super feeble window manager
============================
sfwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic WM based on dwm.


Requirements
------------
In order to build sfwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sfwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sfwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.



The configuration of sfwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and recompiling the source code.
